# login-project

I created this project to enhance my skills and knowledge.

It comprises a Login and Registration page.

The Login page incorporates a JavaScript validation that checks if the fields are filled. If they are not, an alert is displayed.

The registration page includes another validation system that verifies whether the two passwords entered by the user match or not. In case of a mismatch, an alert is triggered.
